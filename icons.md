(Primary color for these icons: Secondary Accent Amber/Warm Yellow #FFC107 unless specified)

    Icon: Welcome Pass NFT

        Concept: Represents a digital pass, access, and uniqueness.

        Key Visual Elements:

            A stylized ticket or pass shape. The ticket should have a modern feel, not an old-fashioned paper ticket.

            The main body of the ticket should be rectangular with one edge having a perforated or scalloped look (subtle, 2-3 scallops).

            On the surface of the ticket, include a small, abstract representation of a QR code (a few small squares arranged in a corner) or a unique identifier symbol (like a stylized shield or a star).

            Optionally, a very subtle "NFT" text or a blockchain-like hexagonal pattern subtly integrated into the pass design if it doesn't clutter.

        Composition: The pass should be the central element, slightly angled for a dynamic feel if desired, but primarily front-facing.

        Color: Main pass shape in Amber/Warm Yellow (#FFC107). QR/identifier symbol in Dark Gray (#343A40) or White if on a solid amber fill.

        Avoid: Complex imagery on the pass, realistic textures.

        Overall Impression: Modern access, digital identity, exclusivity.

    Icon: Local Value Network (Solana Pay & FUKU Coin)

        Concept: Represents local commerce, payments, and a circulating currency.

        Key Visual Elements:

            A stylized storefront or shop awning (simple, iconic outline).

            Below or in front of the awning, two interconnected elements:

                A simple, modern coin symbol (circle with a subtle "S" for Solana or a "¥"-like symbol for currency, or an abstract "F" for FUKU).

                A small, sleek payment terminal or a "tap-to-pay" wave symbol.

            Alternatively, a circular arrow design indicating flow/circulation, with a small shop icon and a coin icon integrated within the flow.

        Composition: The shop awning provides context. The coin and payment symbol should be clearly visible and interacting.

        Color: Awning outline in Amber/Warm Yellow (#FFC107). Coin and payment symbol could use Dark Gray (#343A40) for detail or a slightly lighter shade of Amber.

        Avoid: Too many products under the awning, overly detailed coin.

        Overall Impression: Local economy, easy payments, community currency.

    Icon: Skills Hub (DID & Gigs)

        Concept: Represents talent, connection, opportunities, and identity.

        Key Visual Elements:

            A stylized human silhouette or bust (head and shoulders, very minimalist).

            Overlapping or connected to the silhouette, a speech bubble or a "connection" node/network graphic (simple lines and dots).

            Inside the speech bubble or near the silhouette, a small "briefcase" icon or a "gear" icon representing skills/work.

            A subtle element representing digital identity, like a stylized ID card outline or a checkmark for verification.

        Composition: Silhouette as the base, with other elements clearly indicating communication, skills, and identity.

        Color: Silhouette and briefcase/gear in Amber/Warm Yellow (#FFC107). Speech bubble/network lines and ID element in Dark Gray (#343A40) or a lighter amber.

        Avoid: Detailed facial features, complex network diagrams.

        Overall Impression: Talent connection, professional opportunities, verified identity.

    Icon: Community Fund (DAO)

        Concept: Represents collective funding, community governance, and growth.

        Key Visual Elements:

            A stylized group of people (3 simple abstract figures) or several hands coming together towards a central point.

            The central point could be a growing plant/sapling or a coin stack with an upward arrow.

            Alternatively, a circular diagram with segments representing shared ownership or voting, with a community symbol (like a simple house or group of houses) in the center.

        Composition: Emphasis on unity and collective effort leading to growth or decision-making.

        Color: Figures/hands and central growth element in Amber/Warm Yellow (#FFC107). Details or outlines in Dark Gray (#343A40).

        Avoid: Overly complex DAO diagrams, too many individual figures.

        Overall Impression: Community collaboration, shared investment, local impact.

Icons for Why Solana Page - Key Benefits Section (3.5)

(Primary color for these icons: Can alternate between Primary Teal Blue #00A9A5 and Secondary Accent Amber/Warm Yellow #FFC107 for visual variety, or use one consistently. If Solana Brand Colors are used, they should be for specific accents, not the whole icon.)

    Icon: Lightning Speed

        Concept: High transaction speed, quickness.

        Key Visual Elements: A stylized lightning bolt. It should be sleek and modern, not jagged or cartoonish.

            Optionally, the lightning bolt could be shown with subtle motion lines trailing it to emphasize speed.

            Alternatively, a sleek rocket or a fast-forward symbol (>>).

        Color: Primary Teal Blue (#00A9A5) or Amber/Warm Yellow (#FFC107). Motion lines in a lighter shade or Dark Gray.

        Avoid: Overly aggressive or sharp points.

        Overall Impression: Fast, efficient, instantaneous.

    Icon: Ultra-Low Costs

        Concept: Affordability, minimal fees.

        Key Visual Elements: A coin symbol (simple circle) with a downward-pointing arrow next to it or passing through it.

            The arrow should be sleek.

            Alternatively, a stack of coins where one coin at the top is very small or almost transparent, indicating reduction.

            Or, a price tag symbol with a very small number or a percentage down symbol.

        Color: Coin in Amber/Warm Yellow (#FFC107). Arrow in Primary Teal Blue (#00A9A5) or Dark Gray.

        Avoid: Complex currency symbols, piggy banks.

        Overall Impression: Economical, cost-effective, accessible.

    Icon: Massive Scalability

        Concept: Ability to grow, handle large volumes.

        Key Visual Elements:

            A series of expanding concentric circles or squares, starting small and growing outwards.

            Alternatively, an upward-trending arrow that is also widening as it goes up.

            Or, a network graph that is clearly expanding from a few nodes to many.

        Color: Primary Teal Blue (#00A9A5). If using multiple lines/shapes, they can be slightly varying shades of teal or use Amber (#FFC107) for an inner element.

        Avoid: Overly complex or dense network diagrams that look cluttered at small sizes.

        Overall Impression: Growth, capacity, robust.

    Icon: Vibrant Ecosystem

        Concept: A thriving community, many interconnected projects.

        Key Visual Elements:

            A central node with multiple smaller nodes connected to it and to each other, forming a balanced, harmonious network.

            Alternatively, a stylized beehive or a tree with many branches and leaves, symbolizing interconnected growth and activity.

            The nodes could be simple circles or soft hexagons.

        Color: Nodes in Amber/Warm Yellow (#FFC107), connecting lines in Primary Teal Blue (#00A9A5) or Dark Gray. Or, if using a tree, trunk in Dark Gray, leaves in Teal and Amber.

        Avoid: Unbalanced or chaotic network.

        Overall Impression: Interconnected, thriving, diverse, collaborative.

    Icon: Eco-Friendly

        Concept: Low energy consumption, sustainability (referencing Proof of Stake).

        Key Visual Elements: A stylized green leaf (simple, modern shape).

            Optionally, the leaf could be combined with a subtle power plug symbol that has a "low power" indicator (e.g., a small spark instead of a full bolt) or a recycling symbol subtly integrated.

            Or, a leaf forming part of a circle with a subtle power/energy symbol inside.

        Color: Leaf primarily in Solana Green (#14F195) or a similar vibrant green. Accents in Primary Teal Blue (#00A9A5) or Dark Gray.

        Avoid: Overly detailed leaf veins, complex environmental scenes.

        Overall Impression: Sustainable, green technology, efficient.

Icon for Dashboard Page - FUKU Coin Balance (3.3)

    Icon: FUKU Coin

        Concept: The specific digital currency of the platform. This is more of a mini-logo for the coin itself.

        Key Visual Elements:

            A clean, modern circular coin shape.

            Prominently feature a stylized "F" (for FUKU) in the center. The "F" should be unique and modern, perhaps with a slightly rounded or geometric design.

            Consider incorporating a very subtle element related to Fukuoka if possible without clutter (e.g., a highly abstracted representation of the Fukuoka Tower's silhouette or a local motif if one is simple enough, but this is secondary to the "F").

            A subtle shine or highlight on one edge of the coin to give it a slight 3D feel, but still predominantly flat.

        Composition: The "F" should be dominant and clear within the circle.

        Color: Coin body in Secondary Accent Amber/Warm Yellow (#FFC107). The "F" could be in Dark Gray (#343A40) for contrast, or embossed/debossed in the Amber. A subtle highlight in a lighter shade of Amber or White.

        Avoid: Traditional currency symbols like "$", "¥" unless the "F" itself is styled to subtly evoke a currency mark. Avoid overly complex patterns on the coin face.

        Overall Impression: Unique digital currency, modern, trustworthy, tied to the platform.
